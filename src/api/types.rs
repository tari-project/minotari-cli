//! API request and response types for the Minotari wallet REST API.
//!
//! This module contains the data structures used for serializing and
//! deserializing API request bodies and response payloads. It includes
//! wrapper types for proper JSON representation of Tari-specific types.
//!
//! # Key Types
//!
//! - [`TariAddressBase58`]: Wrapper for Tari addresses with Base58 serialization
//! - [`LockFundsResult`]: Response type for the lock funds endpoint
//!
//! # Serialization Format
//!
//! All types in this module use JSON serialization via Serde. Numeric amounts
//! are represented as unsigned 64-bit integers (MicroMinotari), and addresses
//! use Base58 encoding for human-readable representation.

/// A wrapper type for [`TariAddress`] with Base58 serialization.
///
/// This type provides JSON serialization and deserialization of Tari addresses
/// using Base58 encoding, which is the standard human-readable format for
/// Tari addresses.
///
/// # Serialization
///
/// When serialized to JSON, the address is represented as a Base58-encoded string:
///
/// ```json
/// "f4FxMqKAPDMqAjh6hTpCnLKfEu3MmS7NRu2YmKZPvZHc2K"
/// ```
///
/// # Deserialization
///
/// When deserializing from JSON, the string is parsed as a Base58-encoded
/// Tari address. Invalid addresses will result in a deserialization error.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use crate::api::types::TariAddressBase58;
///
/// #[derive(Deserialize)]
/// struct Request {
///     recipient: TariAddressBase58,
/// }
///
/// // JSON: {"recipient": "f4FxMqKAPDMqAjh6hTpC..."}
/// ```
