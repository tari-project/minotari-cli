//! Block processing logic for wallet output detection and balance tracking.
//!
//! This module contains the [`BlockProcessor`] which is responsible for analyzing
//! scanned blocks to detect wallet-owned outputs, track spending via inputs,
//! manage confirmation status, and emit events for each processed block.

/// The `BlockProcessor` is the workhorse of the scanning system. For each block,
/// it performs the following operations:
///
/// 1. **Output Detection**: Identifies outputs owned by the wallet and persists them
/// 2. **Input Tracking**: Detects when wallet outputs are spent as inputs
/// 3. **Confirmation Tracking**: Updates output confirmation status as blocks mature
/// 4. **Balance Changes**: Records all balance-affecting events
