    ///    (and most volatile) blocks.

    /// 2. **Phase 2 – Recent full scan** (`fast_sync_target_height` → tip):
    ///    Performs a complete scan of the remaining, recent blocks up to the
    ///    chain tip. After this phase the wallet balance is fully accurate.

    ///    build complete transaction history (including spending records for
    ///    outputs that may have been spent within the Phase 1 range).
    ///
    /// # Safety Buffer
    ///
    /// The `safety_buffer` defines how many blocks from the tip to treat as
    /// "recent". A larger buffer means Phase 1 covers a smaller range and
    /// Phase 2 covers a larger range. The default is [`DEFAULT_FAST_SYNC_SAFETY_BUFFER`]
