//! Binding idempotency keys to the request that issued them.
//!
//! # Why a bare key is not enough
//!
//! An idempotency key on its own is just a client-chosen string. Every
//! fund-moving entry point in this wallet reaches [`FundLocker::lock`] with one,
//! and the lock short-circuits when a pending transaction for that key already
//! exists — handing back the UTXOs the *original* request reserved.
//!
//! If the key is not tied to the request that created it, that short-circuit is
//! an attack:
//!
//! * **Body swap.** Replay a client's key at `/create_unsigned_transaction`
//!   with different `recipients`. The cached lock is returned, the recipients
//!   are taken from the *replayed* body, and the wallet builds an unsigned
//!   transaction paying the attacker out of the victim's reserved UTXOs.
//! * **Operation swap.** The key namespace was shared across every endpoint, so
//!   a key issued at `/lock_funds` could be replayed at `/burn`. The burn takes
//!   the cached lock and broadcasts a burn — irreversibly destroying funds the
//!   client only meant to reserve.
//!
//! # The binding
//!
//! An [`IdempotencyBinding`] carries three things: the client's key, the
//! [`IdempotencyOperation`] it was issued for, and a [`RequestFingerprint`] over
//! every request field that determines what the wallet actually does. Both the
//! operation and the fingerprint are stored alongside the pending transaction.
//!
//! On replay the stored pair is compared with the incoming one. A key may only
//! short-circuit into a lock created by *the same operation with the same
//! parameters*; anything else is an [`IdempotencyConflict`] (HTTP 409), never a
//! silent hand-back of someone else's UTXOs.
//!
//! # Building a fingerprint
//!
//! Include every field that changes where the money goes or how much of it
//! moves. Omitting one re-opens the body-swap hole for that field, so err
//! towards including too much: the cost of an over-strict fingerprint is a
//! client having to pick a new key, and the cost of an under-strict one is
//! funds paid to an attacker.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let binding = IdempotencyBinding::new(
//!     body.idempotency_key,
