//! High-level transaction management and broadcasting.
//!
//! This module provides the [`TransactionSender`] which orchestrates the complete
//! transaction lifecycle from creation through broadcast. It handles:
//!
//! - Transaction validation and idempotency
//! - UTXO selection and locking
//! - Transaction building and preparation for signing
//! - Broadcasting signed transactions to the network
//! - Creating displayable transaction records for UI
//!
//! # Transaction Flow
//!
//! The typical transaction flow using `TransactionSender` is:
//!
//! 1. Create a `TransactionSender` for an account
//! 2. Call [`start_new_transaction`](TransactionSender::start_new_transaction) to prepare an unsigned transaction
//! 3. Sign the transaction externally (e.g., with a hardware wallet)
//! 4. Call [`finalize_transaction_and_broadcast`](TransactionSender::finalize_transaction_and_broadcast) to submit
//!
//! # Idempotency
//!
//! Transactions are identified by idempotency keys, allowing safe retries.
//! If a transaction with the same idempotency key exists, the existing
//! transaction data is returned rather than creating a duplicate.
//!
//! A key only earns that replay when it was issued for this same request; a key
//! replayed with different parameters, or one whose transaction is completed,
//! expired or cancelled, is refused as an
//! [`IdempotencyConflict`](crate::transactions::idempotency::IdempotencyConflict).
//! The check runs inside the same `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction that takes the
//! reservation, so a concurrent retry is served the original *reservation*
//! rather than losing a race to the unique-key index.
//!
//! It is not served the original unsigned transaction. Nothing persists that, so
//! a replay rebuilds one with a fresh `TxId` over the same inputs, and two
//! callers can end up holding structurally different transactions spending the
//! identical UTXOs. Only one of them may broadcast:
//! [`finalize_transaction_and_broadcast`](TransactionSender::finalize_transaction_and_broadcast)
//! claims the reservation with a conditional update and refuses whoever did not
//! win it.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use minotari::transactions::manager::TransactionSender;
//!
//! // Create sender for an account
//! let mut sender = TransactionSender::new(
//!     db_pool,
//!     "my_account".to_string(),
//!     password,
//!     Network::MainNet,
//! ).await?;
//!
//! // Start a new transaction
//! let unsigned = sender.start_new_transaction(
//!     "idempotency-key-123".to_string(),
//!     recipient,
//!     300, // 5 minute lock
//! ).await?;
//!
//! // Sign externally...
//! let signed = sign_transaction(unsigned)?;
//!
//! // Broadcast to network
//! let sent = sender.finalize_transaction_and_broadcast(
//!     signed,
//!     grpc_address,
//! ).await?;
//! if !sent.accepted_by_node {
//!     // Recorded and pending: it will be rebroadcast; do not send it again.
//! }
//! ```
