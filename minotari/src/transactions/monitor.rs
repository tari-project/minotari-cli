//! Transaction monitoring for broadcast, mining, and confirmation.
//!
//! This module provides infrastructure for tracking outbound transactions
//! through their lifecycle from broadcast to final confirmation. It handles:
//!
//! - Rebroadcasting transactions that haven't been picked up
//! - Asking the node whether broadcast transactions are still in its mempool
//! - Tracking confirmation progress
//! - Updating transaction display status for UI
//!
//! The monitor does not detect that a transaction was mined: the wallet's own
//! block scan does that (see `BlockProcessor::match_sends`), so the node is
//! never asked twice. The scan coordinator runs the monitor once a scan pass
//! is caught up or has reached its block limit.
//!
//! # Transaction States
//!
//! Transactions progress through these states:
//!
//! ```text
//! Completed --> Broadcast --> MinedUnconfirmed --> MinedConfirmed
//!     |             |
//!     +-> Rejected <+
//! ```
//!
//! - **Completed**: Transaction is signed and ready for broadcast
//! - **Broadcast**: Transaction has been submitted to the network
//! - **MinedUnconfirmed**: Transaction found in a block but not yet confirmed
//! - **MinedConfirmed**: Transaction has sufficient confirmations
//! - **Rejected**: Transaction was rejected by the network
//!
//! # Confirmation Requirements
//!
//! Transactions require [`REQUIRED_CONFIRMATIONS`] (currently 3) blocks
//! before being considered confirmed. This provides protection against
//! short chain reorganizations.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use minotari::transactions::monitor::{TransactionMonitor, MonitoringState};
//!
//! // Initialize monitoring state
//! let state = MonitoringState::new();
//! state.initialize(&mut conn, account_id).await?;
//!
//! // Create monitor
//! let monitor = TransactionMonitor::new(state.clone());
//!
//! // Check and update transactions during each sync cycle
//! let result = monitor.monitor_if_needed(
//!     &wallet_client,
//!     &mut conn,
//!     account_id,
//!     current_chain_height,
//! ).await?;
//!
//! // Handle events
//! for event in result.wallet_events {
//!     handle_wallet_event(event);
//! }
//! ```
