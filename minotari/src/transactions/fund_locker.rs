//! UTXO locking mechanism for transaction construction.
//!
//! This module provides functionality to temporarily lock UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs)
//! during transaction construction, preventing double-spending scenarios where the same
//! outputs might be selected for multiple concurrent transactions.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! When creating a transaction, the wallet must:
//! 1. Select appropriate UTXOs to cover the transaction amount plus fees
//! 2. Lock those UTXOs to prevent other transactions from using them
//! 3. Either complete the transaction (consuming the UTXOs) or release the lock on failure
//!
//! The [`FundLocker`] handles steps 1 and 2, with automatic expiration to handle step 3
//! in case of failures or timeouts.
//!
//! # Idempotency
//!
//! Lock operations support idempotency keys, allowing clients to safely retry requests
//! without accidentally locking additional funds. If a lock request with the same
//! idempotency key already exists, the original result is returned.
//!
//! A key alone is not enough to authorise that short-circuit. Every caller must
//! supply an [`IdempotencyBinding`], which ties the key to the operation and the
//! exact request that created the lock; a replay that does not match is rejected
//! as an [`IdempotencyConflict`] instead of being handed the reservation. See
//! [`crate::transactions::idempotency`] for what that prevents.

    /// well — at either end of that wait — is what starves the pool:
    ///
    /// * acquiring it *before* the mutex means every queued caller pins a connection while
    ///   doing nothing, so the pool has to be as large as the number of concurrent callers;
    /// * acquiring it *after* the mutex means blocking on checkout while holding the mutex,
    ///   which is safe only for as long as no caller anywhere holds a connection across this
    ///   call — an unwritten rule that three API handlers already broke.
    ///
    /// Taking the caller's connection avoids both. The caller already has one (it looked up
    /// the account with it), the mutex holder arrives holding everything it needs and so
    /// never blocks on another resource, and no caller can accidentally hold a second
    /// connection because there is nowhere to put it. One connection per in-flight request,
    /// enforced by the signature rather than by convention.
    ///
    /// Selects unspent outputs sufficient to cover the requested amount plus estimated
    /// transaction fees, then locks them in the database with an expiration time.

    /// returns the existing lock result without creating a new one.
