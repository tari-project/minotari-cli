//! One-sided (non-interactive) transaction construction.
//!
//! This module provides functionality for creating one-sided transactions, which are
//! transactions that can be sent without requiring any interaction from the recipient.
//! Unlike interactive transactions, one-sided transactions use the recipient's public
//! address to derive the necessary cryptographic components.
//!
//! # One-Sided Transactions
//!
//! One-sided transactions are the primary transaction type for Minotari. They allow
//! a sender to create a complete transaction using only the recipient's Tari address,
//! without any back-and-forth communication. The recipient can later claim the funds
//! by scanning the blockchain.
//!
//! # Transaction Flow
//!
//! 1. Lock UTXOs using [`FundLocker`](super::fund_locker::FundLocker)
//! 2. Create an unsigned transaction using [`OneSidedTransaction::create_unsigned_transaction`]
//! 3. Sign the transaction externally
//! 4. Broadcast the signed transaction to the network
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use minotari::transactions::one_sided_transaction::{OneSidedTransaction, Recipient};
//!
//! let tx_builder = OneSidedTransaction::new(db_pool, Network::MainNet, password);
//!
//! let recipient = Recipient {
//!     address: recipient_address,
//!     amount: MicroMinotari(1_000_000),
//!     payment_id: Some("Invoice #123".to_string()),
//! };
//!
//! let unsigned_tx = tx_builder.create_unsigned_transaction(
//!     &account,
//!     locked_funds,
//!     vec![recipient],
//!     MicroMinotari(5),
//! ).await?;
//! ```
